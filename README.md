# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
# Project Overview
Credit card fraud is a serious issue faced by financial institutions globally. To address this, we employ a deep learning approach using CNN to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate.

# Key Features:
## Dataset: The project uses a public dataset (you can mention the dataset source if it's public).
## Model: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are employed for classification.
## Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
# Model Architecture
## Input Layer: Handles the credit card transaction data.
## CNN Layers: Feature extraction through convolutional layers.
## Dense Layers: Fully connected layers for final classification.
## Output Layer: Binary classification (fraudulent or legitimate).
# Results
The model achieved the following performance metrics:

## Accuracy: X.XX%
## Precision: X.XX%
## Recall: X.XX%
## F1-score: X.XX%
# Usage
After running the notebook, you can visualize the model's predictions and performance metrics. The notebook includes detailed steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
